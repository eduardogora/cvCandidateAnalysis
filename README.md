# cvCandidateAnalysis
Data science project to analyze several CV to determine if an application is good for a job vacancy

This project applies data science techniques to analyze multiple resumes (CVs) and determine whether an application is a good fit for a job vacancy. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP), the model predicts the suitability of a candidate based on various features extracted from their CV

The team is going to use Python as the primary programming language for this project. Additionally, we will conduct an investigation into other techniques that may enhance our approach, ensuring we explore a variety of methodologies to achieve the best results.

Objectives:
Extract key features from resumes (skills, experience, education, keywords).
Analyze patterns in successful and unsuccessful applications.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
